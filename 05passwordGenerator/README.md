# Password Generator Project

In this project, I learned about three important React hooks: `useCallback`, `useRef`, and `useEffect`.

- `useCallback` helps optimize performance by memoizing functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- `useRef` allows access to DOM elements and stores mutable values that persist across renders without causing re-renders.
- `useEffect` is used for side effects like fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions.
- I used `useCallback` to memoize the password generation function.
- `useRef` was used to reference input fields and manage focus.
- With `useEffect`, I handled updates when options changed and performed cleanup tasks.
- These hooks made my code more efficient and easier to manage.
- I now understand how to use hooks to control component behavior and lifecycle.
- This project improved my React skills and taught me best practices for using hooks.
