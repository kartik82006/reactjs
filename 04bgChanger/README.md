## Project: bgChanger & Reusable Components

This project includes a background changer app built with React and Vite. The bgChanger allows users to change the background color dynamically, demonstrating state management and event handling in React.

While building this project, I learned how to create and use reusable components in React. Reusable components help keep code organized, reduce duplication, and make it easier to maintain and scale applications. Examples include custom button components, color pickers, and layout elements that can be used in multiple places throughout the app.

Key learnings:
- How to manage state and props in React
- How to build and use reusable components
- How to handle user events to update UI
- How to structure a React project with Vite
